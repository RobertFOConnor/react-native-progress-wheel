React Native component for creating natively animated, circular progress wheel.

## Example app

![image](preview.gif)

## Why use this component

This implementation is 100% JS, meaning you do not need to use any additional libraries such as 'react-native-svg' and you don't need to do any linking. üò±
This component also sets `useNativeDriver: true`, meaning that all animation is done smoothly on the native side.üíñ

This package is also SUPER-LIGHTWEIGHT.

Let's compare:

react-native-progress-wheel: Unpacked size: 8.74 kB (this library)

react-native-circular-progress: Unpacked size: 3.38 MB (other popular library)

## Installation

    yarn add react-native-progress-wheel

## Usage
```js
import AnimatedProgressWheel from 'react-native-progress-wheel';

<AnimatedProgressWheel 
    size={120} 
    width={20} 
    color={'yellow'}
    progress={45}
    backgroundColor={'orange'}
/>
```

You can define a progress value, and a value from which to animate when the component is mounted.
The following example will animate from 0% to 45% at a duration of 3 seconds.

```js
<AnimatedProgressWheel
    progress={45}
    animateFromValue={0}
    duration={3000}
/>
```

If you want the color to change with the progress, you can use the `fullColor` prop.

```js
<AnimatedProgressWheel
    progress={100}
    animateFromValue={0}
    duration={5000}
    color={'white'}
    fullColor={'red'}
/>
```

The progress wheel can be updated using state variables.

```js
<AnimatedProgressWheel
    progress={this.state.sliderProgress}
/>
```

You can also use a ref to call the components 'animateTo' method to update the progress wheel.

```js
this.progressWheel.animateTo(100, 2000, Easing.quad); // Will fill the progress bar linearly in 2 seconds
```

## Configuration

You can configure the component using these props:

Name             | Type                   | Default value           | Description
-----------------|------------------------|-------------------------|--------------
size             | number                 | 200                     | Width and height of circle
width            | number                 | 25                      | Thickness of the progress line
color            | string                 | white                   | Color of the progress line
backgroundColor  | string                 | gray                    | Color of the background progress line
progress         | number (0, 100)        | 0                       | Angle from which the progress starts from
animateFromValue | number (0, 100)        | -1                      | Starting value to animate to progres when component is mounted
duration         | number                 | 600                     | Duration at which to animate the progress.
