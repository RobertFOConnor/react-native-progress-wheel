React Native component for creating natively animated, circular progress wheel.

## Example app

![image](preview.gif)

## Why use this component

This implementation is 100% JS, meaning you do not need to use any additional libraries such as 'react-native-svg' and you don't need to do any linking. üò±
This component also sets `useNativeDriver: true`, meaning that all animation is done smoothly on the native side.üíñ

This package is also SUPER-LIGHTWEIGHT.

Let's compare:

react-native-progress-wheel: Unpacked size: 8.74 kB (this library)

react-native-circular-progress: Unpacked size: 3.38 MB (other popular library)

## Installation

    yarn add react-native-progress-wheel

## Usage
```js
import AnimatedProgressWheel from 'react-native-progress-wheel';

<AnimatedProgressWheel 
    size={120} 
    width={20} 
    color={'yellow'}
    progress={45}
    backgroundColor={'orange'}
/>
```

You can define a progress value, and a value from which to animate when the component is mounted.
The following example will animate from 0% to 45% at a duration of 3 seconds.

```js
<AnimatedProgressWheel
    progress={45}
    animateFromValue={0}
    duration={3000}
/>
```

The progress wheel can be updated using state variables.

```js
<AnimatedProgressWheel
    progress={this.state.sliderProgress}
/>
```
