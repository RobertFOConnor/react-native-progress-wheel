React Native component for creating natively animated, circular progress wheel.

## Example app

![image](preview.gif)

## Installation

    yarn add react-native-progress-wheel

## Usage
```js
import AnimatedProgressWheel from 'react-native-progress-wheel';

<AnimatedProgressWheel 
    size={120}
    width={20} 
    color={'yellow'}
    progress={45}
    backgroundColor={'orange'}
/>
```

You can define a progress value, and a value from which to animate when the component is mounted.
The following example will animate from 0% to 45% at a duration of 3 seconds.

```js
<AnimatedProgressWheel
    progress={45}
    animateFromValue={0}
    duration={3000}
/>
```


The progress wheel can display progess as titles in the center of the circle.

```js
<AnimatedProgressWheel
        max={40}
        showProgressLabel={true}
        rotation={'-90deg'}
        labelStyle={styles.progressLabel}
        subtitle={'Questions out of 40'}
        subtitleStyle={styles.subtitle}
        {...{color, backgroundColor, size, width, duration, progress, rounded}}
      />
```

The progress wheel can be updated using state variables.

```js
<AnimatedProgressWheel
    progress={this.state.sliderProgress}
/>
```

## Why use this component

This implementation is 100% base react-native, meaning you do not need to use any additional libraries such as 'react-native-svg' or 'react-native-reanimated'.
This component also sets `useNativeDriver: true`, meaning that all animation is done smoothly on the native side.üíñ

This package is also SUPER-LIGHTWEIGHT.
